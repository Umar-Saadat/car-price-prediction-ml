# 🚗 Car Price Prediction ML Model

This project predicts the **price of used cars** using **Linear Regression** based on features like brand, year, mileage, engine, fuel type, and more.  
Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, it allows users to estimate car prices interactively.

---

## 🧠 Overview
The model is trained on the `Cardetails.csv` dataset using **Linear Regression** and deployed via a **Streamlit** web app.
